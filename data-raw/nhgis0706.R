# Make simplified versions of GIS files from NHGIS extracts for use in
# package examples and tests.
#
# NHGIS GIS files are typically too large to be included on GitHub or on CRAN,
# but these files are useful for examples and testing. We simplify the GIS
# files and repackage them to reduce file size while maintaining the same
# file structure.
#
# This pipeline has been updated to improve reproducibility of example data.
#
# This script produces:
#   * ipumsexamples/inst/extdata/nhgis0706_shape.zip
#   * ipumsexamples/inst/extdata/nhgis0706_csv.zip
#
# Which are updated versions of:
#   * ipumsexamples/inst/extdata/nhgis0024_shape.zip
#   * ipumsexamples/inst/extdata/nhgis0024_csv.zip
#
# The extract specifications are identical between these versions, but
# NHGIS has since added new content to the data files for many NHGIS datasets,
# so the files may not be identical.
#
# The original versions were made using the extract GUI.
#
# Note that if this code is re-run to produce new files, the files will be
# updated with new extract numbers. Code that references these files will
# need to be updated accordingly.
