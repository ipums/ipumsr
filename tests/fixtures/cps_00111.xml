  <labl>Annual Social and Economic Supplement Household weight</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[ASECWTH is a household-level weight that should be used to generate statistics about households in March Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement data. The CPS uses a complex stratified sampling scheme, and ASECWTH must be used to produce unbiased household-level statistics from the IPUMS-CPS ASEC data. For analyses of non-ASEC data, researchers should use HWTFINL. For individual-level analyses, researchers should use WTFINL, ASECWT, or EARNWT. 

ASECWTH generally has the same value as WTSUPP for the household head or reference person. Vacant housing units and households that could not be interviewed due to residents' absence or refusal to participate have a value of zero in HWTSUPP; such sampled units were included in the public use CPS data beginning in 1988. 

Estimates on the entire population are prepared by projecting forward the resident population from the last available census. These projections are derived by updating the demographic census data from a number of other data sources that account for death, births and net migration. About 3 years after every census (i.e. 2003 for the 2000 Census and 2013 for the 2010 Census), the Census Bureau updates its independent population control and provides a new weight for the relevant years.

Two important points should be noted here. First, the lag between when the Census is conducted and when the CPS weights are updated is about 3 years. While the Census data are being processed, the CPS files are made available using the weighting scheme from the US Census prior to the latest Census. Second, once the files are updated, the old weights become obsolete and are replaced in the IPUMS data extract system. Published estimates from the lag years that use the old weights are not always updated. For example, 2010 poverty estimates were released in ASEC using the 2000 population controls. Once the 2010 population controls were made available, IPUMS-CPS replaced the ASEC 2010, 2011, and 2012 weights that are based on the 2000 population control with weights that are based on the 2010 population controls.

IPUMS-CPS makes available only the most up-to-date weights. The old values are available here: Old SPM and Weights Values.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[CPSIDP is an IPUMS CPS defined variable that uniquely identifies individuals across CPS samples. The first six digits of CPSIDP index the four-digit year and two-digit month that the household was first in the CPS. CPSIDP allows users to link a respondent appearing with a designated household roster line number (LINENO) across samples, based on the 4-8-4 rotation pattern, by assigning a unique CPSIDP value to this line number. CPSIDP will only ever appear for a maximum of 8 times, which is the number of times a household may be observed in the CPS survey (as indexed by MISH). In some cases, individuals will appear fewer than 8 times due to migration, mortality, non-response, and recording errors. Extensive documentation about the creation of CPSIDP is available elsewhere.

Users should note that it is important to verify CPSIDP linkages with AGE, SEX, and RACE. In some cases CPSIDP will result in erroneous links, which are due to errors in the source data. Cases with the same CPSIDP value may also have inconsistent responses across samples due to errors on the part of the respondent or in recording the response. Ultimately, it is up to the individual researcher to determine the acceptability of the linkages made using CPSIDP. 

CPSIDP may also be used to link ASEC respondents who are in the March Basic Monthly file to other months of CPS data. This linking is made possible by IPUMS through the creation of MARBASECIDP. 

To get started using CPSIDP, users may want to sort their data file by CPSIDP and MISH to create a person-time file. 

Users should take care when including the March Basic or ASEC as part of their linking. Respondents who are part of the ASEC oversample (as indicated by ASECOVERP) have a CPSIDP value of 0.

  <txt><![CDATA[CPSIDV is an IPUMS CPS-created variable that uniquely identifies individuals across CPS samples. In addition to linking records across the CPS 4-8-4 rotation pattern, CPSIDV only makes links between those records whose SEX and RACE values do not change and whose AGE values change in expected ways over time. 

CPSIDV is based on CPSIDP and so there are some structural similarities between them. The first six digits of CPSIDV are identical to CPSIDP - the four-digit year and two-digit month that the household was first in the CPS. Like CPSIDP, CPSIDV allows users to link a respondent appearing with a designated household roster line number (LINENO) across samples, based on the 4-8-4 rotation pattern. 

Only records that link using CPSIDP that also have consistent race and sex values and age values that increase at least one but not more than two years over the course of the 16-month CPS rotation are linkable using CPSIDV. As a result, linkage rates using CPSIDV are slightly lower than those achieved using CPSIDP. However, linkages created with CPSIDV do not require the recommended post-linking verification steps recommended for use with CPSIDP links. Users should note that original, unharmonized values of age, sex, and race are used in the creation of CPSIDV. The procedure and validation criteria for creating CPSIDV are described in detail in A Holistic Approach to Validating Current Population Survey Panel Data. 

CPSIDV may also be used to link ASEC respondents who are in the March Basic Monthly file to other months of CPS data. This linking is made possible by IPUMS through the creation of MARBASECIDP. 

To get started using CPSIDV, users may want to sort their data file by CPSIDV and MISH to create a person-time file.

  <labl>Annual Social and Economic Supplement Weight</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[ASECWT is a person-level weight that should be used in analyses of individual-level CPS supplement data. Since the CPS relies on a complex stratified sampling scheme, it is essential to use one of the provided weighting variables.

Researchers should use WTFINL rather than ASECWT when they wish to conduct person-level analyses of non-ASEC data. EARNWT should be used for any analysis including a small number of person-level variables (EARNWEEK, HOURWAGE, PAIDHOUR, and UNION). Researchers should use ASECWTH for household-level analyses. ASECWTCVD is available for the 2020 ASEC to adjust for nonrandom nonresponse resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

User Caution: For analyses that include the 2014 ASEC sample, please see the comparability tab.

The ASEC CPS files include two groups of people who are not included in the production of published labor force statistics: (1) members of the armed services, and (2) members of the Hispanic oversample who were interviewed in months other than March. WTFINL and EARNWT assign these groups a value of 0. Both groups are assigned non-zero values in ASECWT.

ASECWT is based on the inverse probability of selection into the sample and adjustments for the following factors: failure to obtain an interview; sampling within large sample units; the known distribution of the entire population according to age, sex, and race; over-sampling Hispanic persons; to give husbands and wives the same weight; and an additional step to provide consistency with labor force estimates from the basic survey. 

Estimates on the entire population are prepared by projecting forward the resident population from the last available census. These projections are derived by updating the demographic census data from a number of other data sources that account for death, births and net migration. About 3 years after every census (i.e. 2003 for the 2000 Census and 2013 for the 2010 Census), the Census Bureau updates its independent population control and provides a new weight for the relevant years.

  <txt><![CDATA[OINCFARM reports net earnings as a tenant farmer, sharecropper, or operator of one's own farm during the previous calendar year, if such work did not constitute the longest-held job during that period.  The amount earned (in wages, salary, or earnings from self-employment in a business or farm) from the longest-held job during the preceding calendar year is reported in INCLONGJ.     

Imagine that an individual considered raising crops on her own land to be her primary job, and considered money earned by harvesting crops on another farmer's land for a few days, using her own equipment, to be a secondary "own farm" job.  In such a case, net earnings from the sale of  her own crops would be reported as income in INCLONGJ; earnings from harvesting crops for another farmer would be reported as "other" self-employed own farm income in OINCFARM; and the sum of earnings from crop sales and farm equipment rental would constitute INCFARM.  If, instead, she grouped together all net earnings from crop sales and income generated from the use of her equipment into a single "own farm" business, all of this net farm income would be reported in both INCLONGJ and INCFARM, and the value of OINCFARM would be zero.  

Imagine, instead, that as reported in SRCEARN, an individual worked as an employee earning wages for the primary job, but earned additional income working part of the year on their own farm.  In such a case, wage income from the primary job would be reported in INCLONGJ; all self-employed farm net business earnings would be reported in OINCFARM; and the value of OINCFARM and INCFARM would be the same.
