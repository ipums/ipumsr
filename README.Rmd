ipumsr provides an R interface for handling
[IPUMS](https://www.ipums.org) data, allowing users to:

-   Easily read files downloaded from the IPUMS extract system

-   Request data, download files, and get metadata from certain IPUMS
collections

-   Interpret and process data using the contextual information that is
included with many IPUMS files

## Installation

To install the package from CRAN, use

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ipumsr")
```

To install the development version of the package, use

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ipums/ipumsr")
```

## What is IPUMS?

[IPUMS](https://www.ipums.org/mission-purpose) is the world's largest
publicly available population database, providing census and survey data
from around the world integrated across time and space. IPUMS
integration and documentation make it easy to study change, conduct
comparative research, merge information across data types, and analyze
individuals within family and community context. Data and services are
available free of charge.

IPUMS consists of multiple projects, or collections, that provide
different data products.

-   **Microdata** projects distribute data for individual survey units,
like people or households.
-   **Aggregate data** projects distribute summary tables of aggregate
statistics for particular geographic units along with corresponding
GIS mapping files.

ipumsr supports different levels of functionality for each IPUMS project, as
summarized in the following table:

```{r}
#| echo: false

checkmark <- function() {
  "<img src='man/figures/check-solid.svg' class='icon-check'>"
}

# Difficult to use `proj_config()` to auto-produce this table, as we
# group projects together (e.g. Global Health projects), which is not
# reflected in `proj_config()`. Currently we will need to keep this up-to-date
# manually.

ipumsr uses the [IPUMS API](https://developer.ipums.org/) to submit data
requests, download data extracts, and get metadata, so the scope of
ipumsr functionality generally corresponds to the [available API
functionality](https://developer.ipums.org/docs/v2/apiprogram/apis/). As
the IPUMS team extends the API to support more functionality for more
projects, we aim to extend ipumsr capabilities accordingly.

## Getting started

If you're new to IPUMS data, learn more about what's available through
the [IPUMS Projects Overview](https://www.ipums.org/overview).

The package vignettes are the best place to learn about what's available in 
ipumsr itself:

-   To read IPUMS data extracts into R, see `vignette("ipums-read")`.
-   To interact with the IPUMS extract system via the IPUMS API, see 
    `vignette("ipums-api")`.
-   For additional details about microdata and NHGIS extract requests, see 
    `vignette("ipums-api-micro")` and `vignette("ipums-api-nhgis")`.
-   To work with labelled values in IPUMS data, see `vignette("value-labels")`.
-   For techniques for working with large data extracts, see
    `vignette("ipums-bigdata")`.

The [IPUMS support website](https://www.ipums.org/support) also houses
many project-specific R-based [training
exercises](https://www.ipums.org/support/exercises). However, note that some
of these exercises may not be be up to date with ipumsr's current 
functionality.

-   The [survey](http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/) and
[srvyr](https://github.com/gergness/srvyr/) packages can help you
incorporate IPUMS survey weights into your analysis for various
survey designs.
