# ipumsr 0.8.0

* Require R >= 4.0.0, because we are no longer able to test vignette-building on 
  R 3.6 due to updated requirements in package evaluate.

# ipumsr 0.7.2

* Fix for CRAN checks

# ipumsr 0.7.1

* Minor updates to README and vignettes

# ipumsr 0.7.0

## Function retirements

* ipumsr no longer suggests raster, rgdal, and sp (#23). Removing these
  dependencies requires the retirement of several previously deprecated 
  functions:
  
  * All `read_terra_*()` functions
  * `read_ipums_sp()` (use `read_ipums_sf()` to load spatial data in sf format)
  * `read_ipums_codebook()` (use `read_nhgis_codebook()` to load an NHGIS 
    codebook)
  * `ipums_list_*()` helper functions (instead, use `ipums_list_files()`)
  * `read_nhgis_sf()` and `read_nhgis_sp()` (instead, use `read_ipums_sf()` and 
    `read_nhgis()` to load spatial and tabular data separately, then join
    with an `ipums_shape_join_*()` function)
  
## Other updates
  
* Fixes bug in `ipums_view()` where content would not display properly in
  viewer pane (#19)
  
* RStudio is now explicitly required to launch files in the viewer pane using 
  `ipums_view()`. R console users can still generate stand-alone HTML files
  that can be viewed in a different browser.

* Updates the UI and fixes various bugs in `ipums_website()` (#54):

  * Accepted project names are now consistent with those provided in 
  `ipums_ddi` objects. Shorthand project names as used by the IPUMS API are 
    also accepted.
  * Users can now use the same syntax regardless of whether providing
    an `ipums_ddi` object or a project name. The `project` argument has been
    deprecated.
  * MacOS is now supported
  * The `var` argument is no longer required. Omitting `var` will launch the 
    URL to the homepage for the specified IPUMS project.
  * The `homepage_if_missing` argument now defaults to `FALSE`.
  * The `var_label` argument has been deprecated

* Updates IPUMS projects listed in `ipums_data_collections()`.

* Various documentation updates

# ipumsr 0.6.3

* The ability to read an IPUMS DDI file contained within a zip archive using
`read_ipums_ddi()` has been deprecated. Users must now load DDI files by 
providing the direct path to the uncompressed .xml file.

  This resolves an inconsistency between the behavior
  of `read_ipums_micro_*()` functions when provided a DDI file path as compared to
  an `ipums_ddi` object created with `read_ipums_ddi()`.

* The ability to read IPUMS files by providing the path to their containing 
directory has been deprecated. This affects:

  - `read_nhgis()`
  - `read_ipums_sf()`
  - `read_nhgis_codebook()`
  - `read_ipums_ddi()`
  - `ipums_list_files()`
  
  These functions now require either a zip archive (with the exception of 
  `read_ipums_ddi()`â€”see above) or a direct file path as input.
  
  This has the consequence that `read_ipums_sf()` with `bind_multiple = TRUE`
  requires a zip archive as input if multiple files are to be read and combined.

## Breaking Changes + Deprecations

### IPUMS API

* ipumsr now supports **IPUMS API version 2**, and no longer supports
  either the beta version or version 1 of the IPUMS API.
  
  This means that extract definitions saved in JSON format will no longer
  be compatible with ipumsr via `define_extract_from_json()`. To load 
  extract definitions created under previous API versions, there are two
  options:
  
  - Rewrite the extract definition represented in the JSON file using the
  `define_extract_*()` function for the relevant IPUMS collection, then update
  the saved file with `save_extract_to_json()`.
  
  - Update the JSON file by converting all `snake_case` fields to `camelCase`.
  For instance, `"data_format"` would become `"dataFormat"`.
  The `"api_version"` field will also need to be changed to `"version"` and 
  set equal to `2`.
  
  See the IPUMS developer documentation for more details on
  [API versioning](https://developer.ipums.org/docs/apiprogram/versioning/) and
  [breaking changes](https://developer.ipums.org/docs/apiprogram/changelog/)
  introduced in version 2.
  
* The `ipums_extract` object structure has been updated. For IPUMS microdata 
  projects, `variables` and `samples` are no longer stored as character vectors,
  but as lists. This accommodates new API version 2 features (see below). Use 
  `names(x$variables)` instead of `x$variables` to access variable (and sample)
  names as a character vector.

* `get_recent_extracts_info_*()` functions have been deprecated. Additionally, 
  tabular-formatted extract history is no longer supported, and conversion 
  functions `extract_tbl_to_list()` and `extract_list_to_tbl()` have 
  therefore been deprecated as well.
  
  Use `get_extract_history()` to browse previous extract definitions in list
  format.
  
### IPUMS Readers

* `read_nhgis_sf()` and `read_nhgis_sp()` have been deprecated. Use
  `read_ipums_sf()` and `read_nhgis()` to load spatial and tabular
  data, respectively. Join data with an `ipums_shape_*_join()` function.
  
* `data_layer` and `shape_layer` arguments have been deprecated in favor of
  `file_select` throughout ipumsr. This provides clarity on the intended purpose
  of this argument. Deprecated functions that use the original argument names 
  remain unchanged.

* Support for objects from the sp package has been deprecated because of the 
  upcoming retirement of rgdal. Use `read_ipums_sf()` to load spatial data
  as an `sf` object. To convert to a `Spatial*` object, use `sf::as_Spatial()`.
  
  For more, see r-spatial's 
  [post](https://r-spatial.org/r/2022/04/12/evolution.html) covering the 
  evolution of several spatial packages.

* `read_ipums_sf()` no longer defaults to `bind_multiple = TRUE`.
  
* Individual `ipums_list_*()` functions have been moved to `ipums_list_files()`.
  
* `read_ipums_codebook()` has been deprecated. Use `read_nhgis_codebook()` to
  read NHGIS codebook files. IPUMS Terra codebook files are no longer supported
  (see below)
  
* Example files in `ipums_example()` have been updated and include new file
  names.

### IPUMS Terra
  
* Support for IPUMS Terra has been discontinued. This includes deprecations
  to all `read_terra_*()` functions, the `types = "raster"` option in 
  `ipums_list_files()`, and `read_ipums_codebook()`.

## New Features

### IPUMS API

* Adds API support for IPUMS NHGIS and IPUMS International!
  - Use `define_extract_nhgis()` to create an NHGIS extract definition.
  - Use `define_extract_ipumsi()` to create an IPUMS International extract
    definition.
    
* Adds support for IPUMS API version 2 features! This includes:
  - Detailed variable specifications for IPUMS microdata extract
  definitions, including case selections, attached characteristics, 
  and data quality flags. Use `var_spec()` to add these specifications 
  to variables in your extract definition.
  - Additional definition-wide parameters for IPUMS microdata extracts,
  including `data_quality_flags` and `case_select_who`.
  - Hierarchical extracts for IPUMS microdata extracts. Set 
  `data_structure = "hiearchical"` to create a hierarchical extract definition.
  - Year selection for time series tables in IPUMS NHGIS extract definitions.
  Use `tst_spec()` to add year selections for time series tables.
    
* Adds API support for IPUMS NHGIS metadata
  - Use `get_metadata_nhgis()` to browse NHGIS data sources. Metadata
  is available in summary form for all datasets, data tables, time series 
  tables, and shapefiles as well as for individual datasets, data tables, and
  time series tables.
  
* Allows users to set a default IPUMS collection using
  `set_ipums_default_collection()`. Users with a default collection do not 
  need to specify the IPUMS collection in functions that require it; instead,
  the default collection is used. This is a convenience for users who rely
  primarily on a single IPUMS collection.
  
* `wait_for_extract()` wait intervals no longer double after each status
  check. Instead, intervals increase by 10 seconds with each subsequent check.

### IPUMS readers

* Adds handling for fixed-width NHGIS extracts in `read_nhgis()`.

* `read_nhgis_codebook()` allows reading
  of raw codebook lines (as opposed to extracting codebook information into 
  an `ipums_ddi` object) by setting `raw = TRUE`. Furthermore, `var_info`
  generated from NHGIS codebook files has been updated to include more
  contextual information about the data variables.
  
* `read_nhgis()` now supports additional arguments to refine the data loading
  process. Users can now specify `col_types` manually and read a subset of 
  a data file using `vars` and `n_max`.
  
* `read_nhgis()` now allows users to retain the extra header row included in
  some NHGIS files. Set `remove_extra_header = FALSE` to do so. In general,
  the information contained in the extra header is attached to the data from
  the NHGIS codebook file, but in some cases the extra header may differ
  slightly from the information found in the codebook.
  
## Miscellaneous

* Various bug fixes

* Updates to documentation and vignettes for clarity

# ipumsr 0.5.2

* Add progress bar when downloading extracts

* Removed validate argument from extract revision functions and improved warning
  messages for invalid extract field names when used as arguments.
  
* Fixed bug preventing users from providing their API key directly to
  `submit_extract` and `wait_for_extract`.

# ipumsr 0.5.1

* Added the "Rmd for Reproducible Research" template, which sets up a workflow 
  that leverages the IPUMS API to facilitate sharing your 
  analysis. For more details, see 
  [the blog post](https://blog.popdata.org/reproducible-research-r-markdown-ipumsr-ipums-api/). 
  Credit to @ehrlichd for the template and blog post!
  
* Moved the raster package to Suggests so that it is no longer installed 
  automatically when you install ipumsr. The raster package is only required if 
  you need to read raster extracts from the IPUMS Terra collection, and IPUMS 
  Terra is slated to be decommissioned shortly.

# ipumsr 0.5.0

* Added functions for interacting with the IPUMS API for IPUMS USA and IPUMS 
  CPS. For an overview of this new functionality, see the API vignette with 
  `vignette("ipums-api", package = "ipumsr")`. Special thanks to @robe2037, 
  @renae-r, and @ehrlichd for their work on the API functions!

# ipumsr 0.4.5

* Fixed bug causing a read error for some labeled string variables (#61, thanks 
  @chengchou).
  
* ipumsr now always uses the `haven::labelled()` function to create `labelled`
  vectors, in order to maintain compatibility with developments in the haven and 
  vctrs packages (thanks @gergness!).
  
* ipumsr now requires R 3.5 or greater, in line with the new requirements of 
  package dependency raster.

# ipumsr 0.4.4

* Modify `lbl_define()` test to reflect changes to haven's `labelled` class 
  definition.

# ipumsr 0.4.3

* Add `lbl_define()` function to enable the use of `lbl_relabel()` syntax when  
  creating a new labelled vector from an unlabelled one (#51, thanks 
  @chengchou).
  
* Remove pillar printing from ipumsr, getting rid of pesky warning (#47).

* Improved documentation for `lower_vars` argument (#56, thanks @hrecht).

# ipumsr 0.4.2

* Incorporate bug fix in knitr 1.23 that affected encoding in NHGIS vignette.

# ipumsr 0.4.1
* Remove stringr & tidyr dependencies so installation is a little easier (#41).

* Fix bug in pillar printing of haven's `labelled` objects (#43)
 
# ipumsr 0.4.0
* Add `read_ipums_micro_yield()` and `read_ipums_micro_list_yield()` that 
  read data in 'yields', a concept similar to 'chunks', but with a little
  more flexibility. See the big data vignette 
  (`vignette("ipums-bigdata", package = "ipumsr")`) for more details.

* Fixed a bug when trying to set variable attributes but not value labels (#34).

* Fixed a bug where implicit decimals would be double counted for csv files.

* Argument `rectype_convert` has been removed because it no longer did anything.

* Fixed a typo in vignette "ipums-geography" (#37, @jacobkap).

* Creates a pkgdown site (#38, @jacobkap).

# ipumsr 0.3.0
* Lots of improvements for users who wish to use "big data" sized IPUMS extracts. See 
  the vignette using command `vignette("ipums-bigdata", package = "ipusmr")` for
  the full details. 
  
  * There are now chunked versions of the microdata reading functions 
    which let you perform functions on subsets of the data as you read
    it in (`read_ipums_micro_chunked()` & `ipumsr::read_ipums_micro_list_chunked()`)
    
  * There is a new function `ipums_collect()` which combined `dplyr::collect()` with
    `set_ipums_attributes()` to add value and variable labels to data collected from
    a database.
    
  * When reading gzipped files, ipumsr no longer has to store the full text in memory.
  
* Added pillar printing for labelled classes in tibbles. This means that the 
  label will print the labels alongside the values when printed in a tibble 
  (in a subtle grey color when the terminal supports it). To turn this feature off,
  use command `options("ipumsr.show_pillar_labels" = FALSE).
  
* The approach to reading hierarchical data files is much faster.

* Arguments to `read_ipums_sp()` are now in the same order as `read_ipums_sf()`

* `read_ipums_sf()` and `read_ipums_sp()` gain 2 new arguments `vars` which 
  allows you to pick a subset of variables, and `add_layer_var` which lets 
  you add a variable indicating which layer it came from.

* You can now use your inside voice for variable names with the new argument
  `lower_vars` for `read_ipums_ddi()` and `read_ipums_micro()` family of functions
  so that the variable names are lower case.

* ipumsr is compatible with versions of haven newer than 2.0 (while maintaining 
  compatibility with earlier versions). (#31)

# ipumsr 0.2.0
* IPUMS Terra is now officially supported! Read raster, area or microdata extracts
  using functions `read_terra_raster()`, `read_terra_raster_list()`, 
  `read_terra_area()`, `read_terra_area_sf()`, and `read_terra_micro()`

* Add support for keyvar in DDI, which will (eventually) help link data across
  record types in hierarchical extracts. To be effective, this requires more 
  support on the ipums.org website, which is hopefully coming soon (#25 - thanks 
  @mpadge!)

* Improved main vignette instructions for Safari users (#27)

* Fix for selecting columns from csv extracts (#26 - thanks forum user JCambon_OIS!)

* Fixes for the `ipums_list_*()` family of functions.

# ipumsr 0.1.1

* Fixed a bug in ipums_shape_*_join functions when using integer ID columns. (#16)

* Allow for unzipped folders because Safari on macOS unzips folders by default (#17)

* lbl_relabel behavior is improved so that labels aren't assigned sequentially (#21)
